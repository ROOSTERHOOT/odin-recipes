<h1>Description</h1>
    <p>We make curry at least once every week in our house. Usually, several times a week. It’s comfort food.

    They are simple to make, and you can make a big batch at once. So curries are perfect for meal planning, and to freeze for later. Especially for those busy days and nights. And then you realize there’s delicious curry in the freezer, and all is right with the world again.
    
    The curry powder is usually heavy on coriander, cumin, and black pepper. This blend of spices and flavors gives Sri Lankan curries a unique flavor profile. And the flavor changes with the ingredients that you use it with.</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
<li>3 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
<li>6 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root - peeled, sliced and crushed</li>
<li>3 ½ tablespoons white vinegar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse the beef and pat dry. Crush the garlic cloves into a paste and combine it with the crushed ginger. Add the vinegar, salt, pepper, roasted curry powder, and cayenne. Mix in the beef cubes and toss to coat. Set aside for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the curry leaves and pandan strips. Stir in the onions. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Mix in the beef cubes and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves. Add the tomato paste and water and mix well.</li>
<li>Simmer, covered, on low heat for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Check the curry every half hour; you may need to add more water (up to 1 cup) if the curry is too dry and is sticking to the pan.</li>
