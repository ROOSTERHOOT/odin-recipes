<h1>Description</h1>
    <p>If there’s one dish that I could quite literally make with my eyes closed, this is it. This Sri Lankan Chicken Curry is one that I make and have made AT LEAST once a week for many years now. It’s quintessential comfort food for K and myself, and we are instantly reminded of Sri Lanka, of our childhood, of home, of full and comforting meals, every time we eat this Sri Lankan chicken curry.</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
<li>2 – 3 tbsp coconut oil</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves minced</li>
<li>6 – 7 curry leaves or 2 bay leaves</li>
<li>2 serrano peppers (or regular green chili) cut length-wise, with or without seeds</li>
<li>½ cup water</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Add the coconut oil in to a large saucepan and heat the oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, ginger to the heated oil and cook until softened.</li>
<li>Add curry powder, chili powder/cayenne pepper, paprika, cinnamon, curry leaves and mix to combine. Cook for a few minutes until you start to smell the spices.</li>
<li>Add the chicken, serrano peppers/green chili peppers, salt, 3 roma tomatoes, 1 tsp sugar, and mix to coat. Cook for 10 minutes with the lid off, on medium high heat. Stir frequently to make sure the chicken or the spices don’t burn.</li>
<li>Add coconut milk, water, vinegar, and bring the curry to a boil. If you want less gravy, add less liquid.</li>
